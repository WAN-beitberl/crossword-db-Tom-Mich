The information stored needed to maintain and build the boatload puzzle is for the following columns:
	- Word (type string)
	- LocX (Location of the first letter on the x axis of type integer)
	- LocY (Location of the first letter on the y axis of type integer)
	- Clue (Clue to print next to the puzzle to help solve it of type String)
	- Length (Length of the word of type integer)
	- Axis (Axis to print the word)
	- Id (Number to assign to the word of type integer)
In my opinion, all a single table filled with the mentioned information is all that is necessary
for the acutal puzzle. Excluding the Word, Id and Clue columns, all other columns contain all the relevant
information to construct the grid, since the borders and dimentions can be easily discovered if you find 
The sum of the maximum sum of the length of the word and location of the word for each axis to determine
how to construct it as a rectangle. Additionally, you don't need to find out the blank squares inside the
rectangle since they can be left empty.

The information I believe is not stores in the table is that related to the rectangle, the tables of clues
and the empty spaces. In order to construct puzzle, only keeping track of the words themselves is enough 
without having to know where not to put characters or how to limit the size of the puzzle, since that will
happen naturally just by placing the words on a board. Having to go out of your way to mark the edge of the 
puzzle and blank out the unused spaces wont change the final board if these steps would have been ignored to
begin with.

sqlite> create table tb(Word TEXT PRIMARY KEY, Id Integer, LocatioX Integer, LocationY Integer, Length Integer, Clue Text, Axis Text);
sqlite> INSERT INTO tb (Word, Id, LocationX, LocationY, Length, Clue, Axis) Values ("Example", 1, 0, 0, 7, "Tool to describe", "Y");
sqlite> SELECT * FROM tb;
sqlite> .save tb;
